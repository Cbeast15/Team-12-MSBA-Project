## üéØ Project Scope  
When focusing on the ideas of Generative AI and the different aspects of creating images with the specific artifical intelligence, we decided to focus on the fashion aspect and how AI can help create viuals to appease the customer preferences and designs when shopping.  This personalized apporoach to fashion with AI as a tool to guide the shopper allows the consumer to visualize any aspect of their clothing and create whatever comes to their mind.  With the usage of Generative AI, the approach of shopping has changed, especially for the indecisive consumer.  The fashion industry will only improve and dynamically change the shopping process by including AI in their cart.  From different accessories, to color schemes, anything decision related to fashion can be helped by out focus of Generative Ai, creating images for the consumer to narrow down their search process.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Details  
From the article provided about Generative AI and the creation of images, the article focuses on DALL-E, a model created by OpenAI to create images from different text prompts.  This program allows for different visualizations for different articles of clothing for someone to see whether the clothing line or items would look applicable on a avatar similar to themselves.  With this idea, and the usage for AI being applied to fashion, we created a website to allow for the user to search any keywords to find a specific time period of clothing, or clothing garments to see how it would fit their style or preferences.  This website created using GenAI allows for shoppers to be efficient with their decision making to match their style or ideas for their trip.  Whether its old western style, a specific color, or specific garment, the GenAI website allows for not only uniqueness to their outfit but efficiency when handling decisions.

## üöÄ What's Next  
To improve this AI model, we could enhance the customization of the user by adding specific features to an avatar similar to the user.  Like in different fashion games, an avatar is used to model the specific clothing before purchasing the outfit.  With this, the avatar implementation will allow for a deeper understanding of what the user is purchasing before taking it home to their closet.  Another idea that could be implemented in the future relates to keeping a dynamic loop for inputs from the user and trends from the social atmosphere.  Many fashion statements are updated so quickly and trends are created so quickly that it may not be updated in our model.  To improve this underlying problem, having a dynamic feedback loop to be able to update new clothing or new trends into the model will allow for the utmost creativity and real-time decision making to take place with every single fashion statement made in the world of clothing.

## üèÜ Responsible AI Considerations  
Ethical AI requirements and ensuring clear guidelines are met is one of the most important steps in AI model creation.  Violating any artifical intelligence guidelines not only puts the usage of AI in jeopardy but also the reputation of the creators in jeopardy.  Abiding by AI guidelines to use the model to only help make decision making when looking at different articles of clothing will help the process go smoothly and allow for the model to keep a very well reputation in the artifical intelligence world.  Another ethical consideration that we looked at was the idea of having images that are inclusive to whomever is to use the model.  A diverse and inclusive model can well represent any company that decides to use the model as many different people can make many choices in the style that best fits their personality.
